# Callback

As we know like JavaScript is synchronous, single threaded language. It can Just do one thing at a time, it has just one call-stack and it can execute one thing at a time. Whatever code we give to Javascript will be quickly executed by Javascript engine, it does not wait.

```js
console.log("Namaste");
console.log("JavaScript");
console.log("Season 2");
// Namaste
// JavaScript
// Season 2

// ðŸ’¡ It is quickly printing because `Time, tide & Javascript waits for none.`
```

_But what if we have to delay execution of any line, we could utilize callback, How?_

```js
console.log("Namaste");
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("JavaScript");
}, 5000);
console.log("Season 2");
// Namaste
// Season 2
// JavaScript

// ðŸ’¡ Here we are delaying the execution using callback approach of setTimeout.
```

### ðŸ›’ e-Commerce web app situation

Assume a scenario of e-Commerce web, where one user is placing order, he has added items like, shoes, pants and kurta in cart and now he is placing order. So in backend the situation could look something like this.

```js
const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];
// Two steps to place a order
// 1. Create a Order
// 2. Proceed to Payment

// It could look something like this:
api.createOrder();
api.proceedToPayment();
```

Assumption, once order is created then only we can proceed to payment, so there is a dependency. So How to manage this dependency.
Callback can come as rescue, How?

```js
api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.proceedToPayment();
});
// ðŸ’¡ Over here `createOrder` api is first creating a order then it is responsible to call `api.proceedToPayment()` as part of callback approach.
```

To make it a bit complicated, what if after payment is done, you have to show Order summary by calling `api.showOrderSummary()` and now it has dependency on `api.proceedToPayment()`
Now my code should look something like this:

```js
api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.proceedToPayment(function () {
    api.showOrderSummary();
  });
});
```

Now what if we have to update the wallet, now this will have a dependency over `showOrderSummary`

```js
api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.proceedToPayment(function () {
    api.showOrderSummary(function () {
      api.updateWallet();
    });
  });
});
// ðŸ’¡ Callback Hell
```

When we have a large codebase and multiple apis and have dependency on each other, then we fall into callback hell.
These codes are tough to maintain.
These callback hell structure is also known as **Pyramid of Doom**.
