# Promises

-> Promises are used to handle async operations in JavaScript.

OR
  
-> Promise is a placeholder for certain period of time until we receive value from asynchronous operation.

OR

-> A container for a future value.

```js
const URL = "https://api.github.com/users/alok722";
const user = fetch(URL);

user.then(function (data) {
  console.log(data);
});
// And this is how Promise is used.
// It guarantees that it could be resolved only once, either it could be `success` or `failure`
/**
    A Promise is in one of these states:

    pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
    rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
 */
```


But there is one more issue, callback hell...

```js
// Callback Hell Example
createOrder(cart, function (orderId) {
  proceedToPayment(orderId, function (paymentInf) {
    showOrderSummary(paymentInf, function (balance) {
      updateWalletBalance(balance);
    });
  });
});
// And now above code is expanding horizontally and this is called pyramid of doom.
// Callback hell is ugly and hard to maintain.

// üí° Promise fixes this issue too using `Promise Chaining`
// Example Below is a Promise Chaining
createOrder(cart)
  .then(function (orderId) {
    proceedToPayment(orderId);
  })
  .then(function (paymentInf) {
    showOrderSummary(paymentInf);
  })
  .then(function (balance) {
    updateWalletBalance(balance);
  });

// ‚ö†Ô∏è Common PitFall
// We forget to return promise in Promise Chaining
// The idea is promise/data returned from one .then become data for next .then
// So,
createOrder(cart)
  .then(function (orderId) {
    return proceedToPayment(orderId);
  })
  .then(function (paymentInf) {
    return showOrderSummary(paymentInf);
  })
  .then(function (balance) {
    return updateWalletBalance(balance);
  });

// To improve readability you can use arrow function instead of regular function
```
