# Typescript

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript.


**Why Use TypeScript?**


**Static Typing** TypeScript allows you to specify types for variables, parameters, return values, and more. This helps catch type-related errors during development time.

**Early Error Detection** TypeScript catches errors at compile time rather than at runtime. This allows developers to catch potential bugs early in the development process.

**Code Readability** Developers can easily understand the expected types of variables and function parameters by looking at the code, leading to improved readability and maintainability.
