# undefined vs not defined in JS

* In first phase (memory allocation) JS assigns each variable a placeholder called **undefined**.

* **undefined** is when memory is allocated for the variable, but no value is assigned yet.

* If an object/variable is not even declared/found in memory allocation phase, and tried to access it then it is **Not defined**

* Not Defined !== Undefined

> When variable is declared but not assigned value, its current value is **undefined**. But when the variable itself is not declared but called in code, then it is **not defined**. 

```js
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 25;
console.log(x); // 25
console.log(a); // Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined
```
